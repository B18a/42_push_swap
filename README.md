  Project - push_swap
</h1>

Create a C program that sorts integers using two stacks (a and b) and a limited set of operations, optimizing for the least number of actions.

Key Components
Stacks:

Stack a: Contains a list of unique integers (initially populated).  
Stack b: Starts empty.
Allowed Operations:

Swap: sa (swap top two in a), sb (swap top two in b), ss (both).
Push: pa (push from b to a), pb (push from a to b).
Rotate: ra, rb, rr (shift up), and their reverse counterparts (rra, rrb, rrr).
Output Requirements:

Print the minimal sequence of operations to sort stack a.
Instructions should be separated by newlines.
Handle errors gracefully, printing "Error" if invalid inputs are provided.
Benchmarking
Sort 100 integers in fewer than 700 operations.
Sort 500 integers in fewer than 5500 operations.
